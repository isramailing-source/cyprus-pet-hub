-- Address remaining security warnings

-- 1. Enable leaked password protection for better auth security
-- This will prevent users from using commonly leaked passwords
UPDATE auth.config 
SET leaked_password_protection = true
WHERE parameter = 'leaked_password_protection';

-- Alternative approach if the above doesn't work - this is typically configured in dashboard
-- But we'll add a note for manual configuration

-- 2. Check if we have any extensions in public schema that should be moved
